# The Doomscroll Machine

## Description

In response to ever-decreasing attention spans due to short-form content, I've "developed" a website that transforms any YouTube video into a scrollable feed of 15-second segments. I say "developed", as this was nearly entirely created with AI to demonstrate how easy it is for anyone to create interfaces that exasterbate our problematic relationship with online content. 

This project was inspired by an argument I had a few months ago, where I argued the medium is just as important as the message. What is the difference between watching a movie or reading the book that inspired the movie? What is the difference between watching a movie in its entirety or through a series of scrollable videos? I hope this thought experiment leaves you asking how the design of emerging technology affects it usability, utility, and social wellbeing.

## TODO

 - Randomize order of clips to reflect how social media presents content
 - Add brainrot in lower half of video to maximize engagement
 - Insert random ads thoughout the clips for realism.
